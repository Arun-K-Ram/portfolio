              <p>
I‚Äôve always had a fear of heights....the kind that makes your knees wobble just standing on a third-floor balcony. But thanks to a few slightly reckless yet incredibly supportive friends, I found myself roped in (literally) to the world of rock climbing. It‚Äôs been a challenge, but one I‚Äôm embracing, and I hope to be as skilled as they are someday.
